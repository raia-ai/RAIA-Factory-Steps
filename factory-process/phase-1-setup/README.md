# Phase 1: Setup

**Owner:** Project Manager / Andres Pareja (AP)

**Description:** Once the Sales blueprint/Scope of Work/Contract is established, the client is onboarded through an official onboarding call, which marks the project's start date. During this phase, the necessary project infrastructure is created to ensure all team members have the tools and spaces they need to collaborate effectively. This step is handled automatically by workflows and by the Project Manager (Currently: Andres).

This step requires setting up various client items on the following platforms:

**1. Generate Client Google Folders in Google Drive**.&#x20;

<p align="center">The convention for the folder are as follows: raia Projects Drive -> COMPANY - Agent Description -> Folder for each Factory Step </p>

**2.** Generate Epic & Tasks on the RAF Jira Board&#x20;

**3.** Generate Org in raia2 & Invite RAIA team + Clients&#x20;

**4.** Generate Google Chat Space

**Note**: The card does not move past this step until all infrastructure elements (Jira, Google Drive, Raia Org) are fully configured.
