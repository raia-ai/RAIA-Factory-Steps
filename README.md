# Introduction

Welcome to the RAIA Agent Factory Process documentation. This comprehensive guide outlines the complete lifecycle for building AI agents using our proven 16-step factory methodology.

## What is the Factory Process?

The RAIA Agent Factory Process is a mature, scalable approach to building AI agents that breaks down the entire lifecycle into **16 steps** across **5 key phases**:

1. **Setup** - Blueprint, onboarding, and access management
2. **Auth & Data** - Verification and document preparation
3. **Development** - ETL, auditing, workflows, and agent building
4. **Quality Assurance** - Internal testing, client testing, and end-to-end validation
5. **Live Operations** - Launch, monitoring, long-term support, and completion

## Why This Process?

Our factory model enables us to:

* **Scale operations** - Handle multiple agents simultaneously across the pipeline
* **Maintain quality** - Multiple quality gates catch issues early in the process
* **Manage expectations** - Clear visual process demonstrates value and justifies pricing
* **Reduce bottlenecks** - Specialization allows team members to focus on their expertise
* **Enable client success** - Proven ROI drives repeat business and referrals



## Timeline

While a basic agent can be built in just a few days, our **100-day roadmap** accounts for:

* Custom workflow development
* Client communication and iteration
* Multiple rounds of testing
* Integration complexity

## Getting Started

Navigate through the sections in this documentation to understand each step of the factory process, from initial blueprint to project completion.
