# 2. Access & Credentials

Owner: Project Manager / Andres Pareja (AP)

Description: This step focuses on gathering all necessary access credentials from the client. This includes logins for relevant systems, API keys, and access to training data sources (Example: SharePoint drive.) Several blocking variables can appear in this phase, which can include something such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) or (2FA) codes.

**Key Steps:**

1. Request dedicated logins from client
2. Collect API keys and access tokens
3. Obtain any appropriate Sharepoint, Google Drive links and other folder access
4. Document all credentials in JIRA Space and/or GDrive folder
5. If needed, coordinate MFA/2FA setup with client.

Challenges:

•Clients may need to schedule security compliance meetings or gain approval from their IT/Security Departments before granting access to us.

•MFA/2FA can create bottlenecks if access is tied to a single person's device. The general rule of thumb is Thomas/Rich are the ones who should setup the 2FA/MFA, due to the fact that they will be the ones going in and out of the platforms the most.

•Credentials may be incomplete or lack proper permissions

**Milestone/Deliverable**: Complete set of credentials, MFA/2FA, API keys, etc are all collected and documented
