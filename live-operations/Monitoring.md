**Owner:** RAIA Team (with client participation)

**Description:** Post-launch, the agent's performance is continuously monitored to ensure it is functioning correctly and meeting the client's needs. This includes tracking key metrics, identifying any issues, and making necessary adjustments.

**Key Activities:**
- Monitor agent performance metrics (conversations happening, token usage, n8n executions. etc)
- Track user interactions and feedback
- Identify and resolve any issues
- Make minor adjustments as needed
- Collect data on agent effectiveness
- Provide regular status updates to client
- Address any client concerns or questions

**Monitoring Focus:**
- Response accuracy and quality
- Workflow execution success rates
- Integration scalability
- Performance metrics (response time, uptime, etc.)

**Milestone/Deliverable:** Stable agent performance with no critical issues

**Notes:** This phase ensures the agent continues to perform well in production. The duration varies by client and project complexity. Sometimes a client can start to ramp up usage, example: Sending five times the amount of SMS / Running out of tokens. This would be notified in the Google Chat Space + Sales team for potential upgrade.
