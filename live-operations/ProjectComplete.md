# 15. Project Complete

**Owner:** RAIA Team

**Description:** Once the agent has been running smoothly for a period of time and the client is satisfied with its performance, the project is officially marked as complete. The agent transitions from active development/monitoring to steady-state operation.

**Key Steps:**

1. Conduct final review with client
2. Document lessons learned
3. Archive project documentation
4. Transition to long-term support model (if applicable)
5. Close out project in Jira
6. Celebrate! (Coffee Party ;)

**Completion Criteria:**

* Agent has been running successfully for agreed-upon period
* Client is satisfied with performance
* No outstanding critical issues
* All documentation is complete
* Handoff is complete

**Long-Term Hold:** Some projects may enter a "long-term hold" status rather than complete, especially for clients on retainer or with ongoing support agreements. This is essentially synonymous with project complete but indicates the client relationship continues.

**Milestone/Deliverable:** Final project closeout documentation and client satisfaction confirmation

**Notes:** This marks the end of the factory process for this agent. Clients often return for additional agents once they see the cost benefit of the first one. We then start the whole process over again with a new agent!
