# 14. Long Term Hold

**Owner:** Team

**Description:** After the monitoring phase, some agents enter a long-term hold status where they remain in steady-state operation. This is essentially synonymous with project complete but indicates the client relationship continues with ongoing support agreements or retainer arrangements. The agent is stable, running smoothly, and requires only occasional maintenance or minor adjustments.

**Key Steps:**

1. Maintain agent in steady-state operation
2. Provide ongoing support as needed
3. Monitor for any issues or degradation
4. Make minor updates or adjustments as requested
5. Continue client relationship under retainer or support agreement
6. Keep agent updated with platform changes

**Characteristics:**

* Agent is stable and performing well
* Client is on retainer or ongoing support agreement
* Minimal active development or changes
* Occasional maintenance and updates
* Long-term client relationship

**Example:** Systems who's in a hold till January - agents that are complete but have ongoing client relationships.

**Milestone/Deliverable:** Ongoing stable operation with periodic check-ins

**Notes:** Long-term hold is used for agents that are complete but where the client relationship continues. This distinguishes from "Project Complete" which represents a true closeout. Some projects may stay in this status indefinitely for clients with ongoing support needs.
