# 13. Monitoring

**Owner:** RAIA Team (with client participation)

**Description:** Post-launch, the agent's performance is continuously monitored to ensure it is functioning correctly and meeting the client's needs. This includes tracking key metrics, identifying any issues, and making necessary adjustments.

**Key Steps:**

1. Monitor agent performance metrics (conversations happening, token usage, n8n executions. etc)
2. Track user interactions and feedback
3. Identify and resolve any issues
4. Make minor adjustments as needed
5. Collect data on agent effectiveness
6. Provide regular status updates to client
7. Address any client concerns or questions

**Monitoring Focus:**

* Response accuracy and quality
* Workflow execution success rates
* Integration scalability
* Performance metrics (response time, uptime, etc.)

**Milestone/Deliverable:** Stable agent performance with no critical issues

**Notes:** This phase ensures the agent continues to perform well in production. The duration varies by client and project complexity. Sometimes a client can start to ramp up usage, example: Sending five times the amount of SMS / Running out of tokens. This would be notified in the Google Chat Space + Sales team for potential upgrade.
